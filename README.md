# HibernateEmployeeProject
This is my First Java project using Hibernate Framework and Mysql Connectivity with Simple Employee Details CRUD Operations.
**#ADD OPERATIONS**
can create a new Employee details using their Fname,Lname , Designation.
This will Automatically create a table in the Database.
**#UPDATE OPERATIONS**
Employee Details are if neededcan update using HQL Query 
# NamedQuery
can  rename the table name and can retrieve the all Employee records from the database.
using the named Query syntax.
The hibernate named query is way to use any query by some meaningful name. It is like using alias names. The Hibernate framework provides the concept of named queries so that application programmer need not to scatter queries to all the java code.
# Like Operator 
use to get the Employee records accoridng to the operations and syntax written .
# Logical Operator
used any kind of logical operators like 'AND' , 'OR' , 'NOT' ETC.,
Finally used CRUD OPerations to retrieve the records from the database.
